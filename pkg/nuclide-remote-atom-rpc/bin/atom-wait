# This is a script for people who want to use Atom for things like $GIT_EDITOR
# or $HGEDITOR, but do not want to wait for `atom --wait` because it opens a new
# Atom window, which is slow compared to editors like vi. Note you must have the
# Nuclide (https://atom.io/packages/nuclide) package installed for Atom to use
# this.
#
# This script takes a single file path as an argument and tries various ways of
# opening it:
# 1. Opens the file in a new tab in an existing Atom window. If it successfully
# connects to Atom, then the command will not return until the tab is closed.
# 2. Failing that, if $ATOM_BACKUP_EDITOR is set, then it is used as the command
# to open the specified file.
# 3. Failing that, we fall back to $EDITOR.
#
# To set this as the $GIT_EDITOR on your local machine, run:
#
#     git config --global core.editor "$HOME/.atom/packages/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-remote-atom-rpc/bin/atom-wait"
#
# To set this as the $GIT_EDITOR on your remote machine where the Nuclide
# server is running, export $ATOM_RPC as the path to wherever
# `node_modules/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-remote-atom-rpc/bin/atom` is installed on
# your machine. Then use the path to this script as the value for $GIT_EDITOR.
